                        This is a small site project where I play and write out the first couple of encounters from the <cite>Cyberpunk 2020</cite> adventure book, <cite>Land of the Free</cite>. <cite>Cyberpunk 2020</cite> is a tabletop <abbr title="Role-playing Game">RPG</abbr> system from the late 80's and early 90's not unlike <cite>Dungeons & Dragons</cite>. Instead of using an assortment of polyhedral dice, it uses a streamlined selection of standard d10s and d6s for everything gameplay related. The standard player's handbook describes a world in which a Referee and two to six players, referred to in-universe as Edgerunners, strap on their spike-studded gloves and step into the shoes of diverse individuals inhabiting a dystopian, street cred obsessed future.

                        Overall, it's mainly a short creative writing project, but I've also gone ahead and written an embedded script, adding simple <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>-based navigation to the bottom of the page to change out the contents as needed.

                    We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?
