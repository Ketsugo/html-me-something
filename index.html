                        This is a small site project where I play and write out the first few encounters from the <cite>Cyberpunk 2020</cite> adventure book, <cite>Home of the Brave</cite>. <cite>Cyberpunk 2020</cite> is a tabletop RPG system from the late 80s and early 90s not unlike <cite>Dungeons & Dragons</cite>. The book describes a world in which two to six players, referred to in-universe as Edgerunners, strap on their spike-laden gloves and step into the shoes of individuals inhabiting a dystopian, street cred obsessed future.

                    We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?

                    Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? You really think you can fly that thing? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
